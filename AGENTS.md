Purpose: This repository uses two agent roles. Your role determines which instruction file you must follow.

1. Orchestrator agent: If you are assigned as the orchestrator, read ORCHESTRATOR.md and follow it exactly.
2. Worker agent: If you are assigned as a worker, read WORKER.md and follow it exactly.

Do not proceed with any tasks until you have opened and read the instruction file for your role.
